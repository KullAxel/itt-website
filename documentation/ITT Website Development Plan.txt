ITT Website Development Plan
Project Goal: To develop a professional, conversion-focused website for IT Technicians (ITT) using the Astrowind template, with development tasks executed by the Cursor AI developer agent, facilitated by you.
Key Resources:
* ITT Technicians Business Plan Long.pdf (referred to as "Business Plan")
* Website Development Plan for IT Technicians (ITT).pdf (referred to as "Website Plan")
* Astrowind GitHub Repository: https://github.com/onwidget/astrowind
* Cursor AI Developer Agent
General Principles for Working with Cursor AI:
* Small, Atomic Tasks: Break down each step in this plan further into the smallest logical coding task for Cursor AI.
* Clear Context: For each task, provide Cursor AI with relevant excerpts from the Business Plan, Website Plan, and a persistent project context document (which we will build).
* Specific Instructions: Clearly state the desired outcome, files to modify, Astrowind components to use/adapt, and specific content to include.
* Iterative Refinement: Review Cursor AI's output carefully and be prepared to provide feedback for revisions.
Phase 0: Project Setup & Foundation
Objective: Establish the development environment, understand the Astrowind template, and create initial context documentation for Cursor AI.
* Task 0.1: Environment Setup with Astrowind
   * Instructions for Facilitator:
      1. Guide Cursor AI (or perform manually if simpler for setup) to fork or use the Astrowind GitHub template to create a new repository for the ITT website.
      2. Instruct Cursor AI to clone the repository to the local development environment.
      3. Have Cursor AI install all necessary dependencies (e.g., npm install as per Astrowind docs).
      4. Instruct Cursor AI to run the local development server (e.g., npm run dev) to confirm the template is working.
   * Documentation to Prepare for Cursor AI (Context for this task & ongoing project context):
      * File: project_context.md (Create this file)
      * Content:
         * Project Name: IT Technicians (ITT) Website
         * GitHub Repository URL: [Link to the new repository]
         * Local Setup Commands: git clone [URL], npm install, npm run dev
         * Core Technologies: Astro, Tailwind CSS, Markdown (MDX for blog if used by Astrowind).

   * Instructions for Facilitator:
      1. Once the site is largely complete and tested, plan to get feedback from a small group of internal users or stakeholders.
      2. Be prepared to iterate on design and content based on this feedback, breaking down changes into tasks for Cursor AI.
This plan provides a structured approach. Remember that flexibility is important. You may need to adjust tasks or their order based on how development progresses with Cursor AI and the specifics of the Astrowind template. Consistent, clear communication and context for Cursor AI will be the keys to a successful project.
