        Founded by an experienced field IT engineer who witnessed firsthand the frustrations of inconsistent, fragmented IT support, IT Technicians was born out of a desire to do things differently. We saw businesses struggling with a revolving door of contractors, escalating costs, and the constant headache of managing IT across multiple locations without dedicated on-site expertise. Our founder envisioned a service that bridged this gap: connecting businesses directly with dedicated, highly skilled field technicians who not only fix problems but become an integral part of their clients' success. This vision is built on fostering long-term partnerships, ensuring continuity of knowledge, and leveraging technology to make expert IT support more accessible and effective than ever before.

        With over a decade of distinguished experience in the IT industry, Alexandru Fartade, founder of ITT, brings a wealth of knowledge and a forward-thinking vision to the forefront of IT service solutions. His extensive career as a Consultant Network Engineer, specializing in Vendor IT Management and Emergency IT Support, has provided him with a unique perspective on the challenges and inefficiencies within the traditional IT service model.

Alexandru has a proven track record of managing complex technical programs and providing critical network support for globally recognized organizations, including Hilton and Cisco. His hands-on experience in maintaining multi-site network operations, managing Cisco Enterprise and Meraki equipment, and leading high-priority incident resolutions has solidified his reputation as a calm, wise, and exceptionally competent IT professional.

It was through these years of dedicated service that Alexandru identified a critical need within the industry: a more direct, efficient, and transparent way for corporations and businesses to connect with specialized IT technicians. He witnessed firsthand the common practice of companies hiring IT firms, only to see projects subcontracted through multiple layers, often diluting expertise and increasing costs.

Driven by a passion for technology and a commitment to streamlining IT solutions, Alexandru founded ITT. His vision is to empower businesses with direct access to a curated database of highly skilled technicians in their local areas. This innovative approach eliminates unnecessary intermediaries, ensuring that companies connect with the precise expertise they require, when they require it.

Recognizing the transformative potential of the upcoming AI wave, Alexandru is further leveraging artificial intelligence to enhance and streamline this process, making ITT a truly next-generation solution for IT service procurement.

Holding certifications such as the Cisco Certified Network Professional (CCNP) and the Cisco Certified Network Associate Industrial (CCNA I), combined with his academic background in Computer Information Technology from Lewis University and College of DuPage, Alexandru possesses both the practical expertise and the foundational knowledge to lead ITT in revolutionizing how businesses access and manage their IT talent. His proficiency in areas like IT Consulting, Network Support, Strategic Planning, and System Administration underscores his comprehensive understanding of the IT landscape.

Alexandru's dedication extends beyond technical proficiency; he is a leader who inspires autonomy through transparency and is committed to putting people first. His entrepreneurial spirit and deep industry insight are the driving forces behind ITT's mission to deliver direct, specialized, and AI-enhanced IT solutions.
